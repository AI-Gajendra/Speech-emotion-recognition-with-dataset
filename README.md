# Speech-emotion-recognition
I am providing a speech emotion recognition model with 93.69% accuracy with no errors in my windows 11 PC.

I have used ravdess, crema, surrey audio and TESS datasets to train my model if you want to train model in your PC/laptop you can download data set from here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4GsRTUoigaky4I-h4qyX3-kgm3SkgSB/view?usp=sharing
