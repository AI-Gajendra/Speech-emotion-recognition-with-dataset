# Speech-emotion-recognition

I am providing a speech emotion recognition model with 93.69% accuracy with no errors in my windows 11 PC.

I have used ravdess, crema, surrey audio and TESS datasets to train my model if you want to train model in your PC/laptop you can download data set from here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4GsRTUoigaky4I-h4qyX3-kgm3SkgSB/view?usp=sharing

and this csv file : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mKEqQSMHxWVBWKI1EQZKsU0YapaymWYe/view?usp=sharing

After downloading dataset zip extract to the same folder where you clone this code 

To test the model open ipynb file and scroll to text script section and run the below code from text script

You have to download all import libraries to run the program without any error.

If you will train this model from zero increase the epoches count to increase accuracy.

If your training model accuracy increase after 95% your model may be overfit on given data.
