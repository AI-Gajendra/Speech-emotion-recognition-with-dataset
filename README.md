# Speech-emotion-recognition
I am providing a speech emotion recognition model with 93.69% accuracy with no errors in my windows 11 PC.

I have used ravdess, crema, surrey audio and TESS datasets to train my model if you want to train model in your PC/laptop you can download data set from here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4GsRTUoigaky4I-h4qyX3-kgm3SkgSB/view?usp=sharing

You have to download all import libraries to run the program without any error.

If you have to train this model from zero increase the epoches cout for increase accuracy.

If your training model accuracy increase after 95% your model may be overfit.
